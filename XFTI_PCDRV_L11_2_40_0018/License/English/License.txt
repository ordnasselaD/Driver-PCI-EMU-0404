You agree that Gracenote, Inc. may enforce its rights under this Agreement against you directly in its own name.

The Gracenote service uses a unique identifier to track queries for statistical purposes.

For more information, see the Gracenote web page for the Gracenote Privacy Policy for the Gracenote service.

The Gracenote Software and each item of Gracenote Data are licensed to you "AS IS."

Gracenote is not obligated to provide you with new enhanced or additional data types or categories that Gracenote may provide in the future and is free to discontinue its services at any time.

GRACENOTE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

13. NO WARRANTY
ANY USE BY YOU OF THE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED FOR USE ONLY WITH CREATIVE'S HARDWARE AND RELATED SOFTWARE.

Further, Creative shall not be liable for the accuracy of any information provided by Creative or third-party technical support personnel, or any damages caused, either directly or indirectly, by acts taken or omissions made by you as a result of such technical support. 

This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from country/state to country/state. Some countries/states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. Creative disclaims all warranties of any kind if the Software was customized, repackaged or altered in any way by any third party other than Creative.
 
14. DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (Section 14 shall not apply to Trial Software. Please refer to Clause C under "Additional Provisions for Trial Software".)

IN NO EVENT WILL CREATIVE’S LIABILITY OR DAMAGES TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON EVER EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO USE THE SOFTWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE CLAIM. BECAUSE SOME STATES/ COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

15. INDEMNIFICATION BY YOU
